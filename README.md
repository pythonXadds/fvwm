## My fvwm configs

"Fvwm is a virtual window manager for the X windows system. It was originally a feeble fork of TWM by Robert Nation in 1993 (fvwm history), and has evolved into the fantastic, fabulous, famous, flexible, and so on, window manager we have today."

**FVWM** is still being maintained and there is now a new version **FVWM 3**
